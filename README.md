# QR Code Generator

This project is built using **React (Vite)** and **Tailwind CSS**.  
In React, it utilizes the **`useState()`** hook to manage the state of the text input field, background color of the QR code, the `src` of the image in the image tag, and the character warning that appears when the user enters the `#` or `&` characters. It also uses the **`useEffect()`** hook, which runs whenever its dependencies change.
